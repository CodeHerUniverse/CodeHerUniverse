## About Me

Olá! I’m Catarina (or just Cat), a Portuguese-British hybrid with a flair for turning data into meaningful (and occasionally sassy) insights. My tech journey began with a simple question: *“How hard can coding really be?”* Spoiler alert — it’s hard. But it’s also ridiculously rewarding, and now I’m hooked.

I recently conquered the **Code First Girls (CFG) Degree in Data Science**, where I learned:

- **Python**: Using it for EDA, data cleaning and manipulation, statistical analysis, visualizations, and more (numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, scipy).
- **APIs**: Building and working with APIs using Flask and requests.
- **Machine Learning**: Building models to forecast, cluster, and classify data, with techniques like feature engineering and model evaluation (scikit-learn).
- **SQL**: Creating, automating, and querying SQL databases.

Basically, how to wrestle unruly datasets into submission. Next on my agenda? Tackling a **Masters+ Certificate in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning with CFG**, because I clearly enjoy keeping life interesting with a side of machine learning models.

Through my role as a Project Manager/Business Analyst at J.P. Morgan, I’ve also mastered:

- **Alteryx** for ETL (currently at Designer Advanced Level).
- Creating standalone Python .exe apps.
- Working with **JIRA** and in a **SaaS SDLC** environment using an **Agile** framework.
  
My work involves analysis, requirements gathering, collaboration with Tech to design solutions, and testing these solutions in a UAT environment.

While I love a good algorithm, my real passion lies in helping women break into tech. The industry needs more brilliant, bold, and badass women, and I’m here to cheer them on (and maybe shove a few through the door if needed). Nothing brings me more joy than seeing someone realise they belong in STEM just as much as anyone else.

When I’m not knee-deep in code or championing women in tech, you’ll find me planning my next travel adventure, writing fiction, or being terrorised by my cat, Nigel. He has a white moustache, an attitude bigger than his whiskers, and zero respect for my personal space.

If you’re into data, sarcasm, and smashing stereotypes, let’s connect — I’m always up for a good chat (and maybe some cat therapy advice).
