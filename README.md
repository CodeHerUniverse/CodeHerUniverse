## About Me

Olá! I’m Catarina (or just Cat), a Portuguese-British hybrid with a flair for turning data into meaningful (and occasionally sassy) insights. My tech journey began with a simple question: *“How hard can coding really be?”* Spoiler alert — it’s hard. But it’s also ridiculously rewarding, and now I’m hooked.

I recently conquered the **Code First Girls (CFG) Degree in Data Science**, where I learned Python, SQL, and how to wrestle unruly datasets into submission. Next on my agenda? Tackling a **Masters+ Certificate in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning with CFG**, because I clearly enjoy keeping life interesting with a side of machine learning models.

While I love a good algorithm, my real passion lies in helping women break into tech. The industry needs more brilliant, bold, and badass women, and I’m here to cheer them on (and maybe shove a few through the door if needed). Nothing brings me more joy than seeing someone realise they belong in STEM just as much as anyone else.

When I’m not knee-deep in code or championing women in tech, you’ll find me planning my next travel adventure, writing fiction, or being terrorized by my cat, Nigel. He has a white moustache, an attitude bigger than his whiskers, and zero respect for my personal space.

If you’re into data, sarcasm, and smashing stereotypes, let’s connect — I’m always up for a good chat (and maybe some cat therapy advice).
